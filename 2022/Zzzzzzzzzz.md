Sleep:

* The book: Why We Sleep.
* Sleep factors:
  * Circadian rhythm
  * Melatonin
  * Adenosine
* Jet lag:
  * To the east, you get a lot of Melatonin but not enough Adenosine.
  * To the west, you get a lot of Adenosine but not enough Melatonin.
* Caffeine blocks Adenosine from reaching the brain. When it disappears, the Adenosine will attack back and you will be really tired.
* Caffeine has a halving time of 6 hours, so it's better to drink it in the morning.
* Two types of sleep:
  * Non-REM: basically cleaning up the brain.
  * REM: dreaming because of the brain waves. The brain will try move the body but because of Muscle atonia. Sleep walkers don't have a correct functioning Muscle atonia.
* With a Hypnogram, you can display all the stages of sleep. It also displays that there is more Non-REM sleep in the beginning. Later you get more REM sleep.
* BHLHE41: Gene for person that is completly fine with less then 6 hours of sleep.
* 1x0h = 10x6h. They are the same but spread over multiple days. You don't even notice that you have sleep deprivation because it resets your baseline.
* 6H sleep can cause around 20% more chance of hearth attacks. This is noticeable when you have to set the clock one hour forward. There are more hearth attacks after that day then on the one hour backwards.
* It also affects our immune system. Sleep less then 5 hours, you are two time mor likely to caught the flu. There will also be less natural killer cells. Also vacines will not properly work.
* For your emotions:
  * Amygdala - the pedal for emotions will work more.
  * Prefrontal cortex - The brake for emotions will work less.
  * Mood swings.
  * Your REM will recognize human emotions.
* For females:
  * < 6 hours = -20% hormones.
  * Can cause miscarriage
* For males:
  * 5 hours a week = +10 years of age
  * Lower sperm cells and smaller balls :)
* 19 hours without sleep = legally drunk attention
* 4 hours of sleep = 11.5 times more likely to have accidents

THe good stuff:

* Non-REM will transfer short memory to long memory.
* Sleeping will help you store memories.
* It will also help with muscle memory.
* REM will connect and find new patterns for solutions.
* Lucid dreaming is a skill to control dreams.

Enough sleep:

* After walking up in the morning, could you fall back a sleep at ten AM?
* Can you function without caffeine in the morning?
* If you didn't set alarm clock, would you sleep past the time.
